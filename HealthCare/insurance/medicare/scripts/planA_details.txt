Enrollees who paid Medicare taxes during their working years or people whose spouse paid these taxes
don’t pay premiums for Medicare Part A once they’re 65 years old. This means you've already paid your
premiums through the 1.45% Medicare payroll tax that you and your employer each paid on all of your wages.
